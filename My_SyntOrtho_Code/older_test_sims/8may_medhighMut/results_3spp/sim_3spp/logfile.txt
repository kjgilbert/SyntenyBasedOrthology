Synthetic evolution
-------------------

first organism (artificial sequences): 25 proteins with 150 aa (average)
height of tree: 1000.00, Speciations: 3


something interesting is happening here...
time 0.0000: speciation event of organism 1 to organism 2
time 443.0301: speciation event of organism 2 to organism 3



75 genes in 3 species generated
